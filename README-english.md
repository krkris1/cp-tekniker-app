# CP-Tekniker Device Management App

A modern, secure, and user-friendly device management solution for NorgesGruppen, built with Flask and designed for Docker. The app is now modular and ready for collaborative development.

---

## Main Features

- **Email-based authentication** with one-time code
- **Role-based access**: Actions filtered by user roles (exact email > domain match)
- **Fetch and create device**: Search by MAC address, create new devices
- **Rate limiting**: Protects against abuse
- **Modern UI**: Tailwind CSS, Lucide icons
- **Runs in Docker**: Simple, reproducible deployment

## How does it work?

1. **Login**: User enters email. If email/domain is approved, a one-time code is sent. Entering the code logs in the user.
2. **Role fetching**: After login, only the roles the user has access to are fetched (exact email has highest priority).
3. **Device management**: User can fetch device info or create new devices, depending on their roles.
4. **Rate limiting**: All sensitive endpoints are protected against abuse.

## Getting Started (Docker)

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd cp-tekniker-app
   ```
2. **Configure environment:**
   - Edit `.env` with your ClearPass API and SMTP settings.
   - Edit `approved_domains.json` to specify allowed emails/domains and roles.
3. **Build and run with Docker:**
   ```sh
   docker build -t cp-tekniker-app .
   docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env -v $(pwd)/approved_domains.json:/app/approved_domains.json cp-tekniker-app
   ```
   The app will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Configuration Files

- **.env**: Environment variables for API, SMTP, and Flask.
- **approved_domains.json**: List of approved emails/domains and their roles.

---

## For Developers

- All backend logic is split into modules and blueprints for easy further development.
- New features should be added to the correct module (auth, clearpass, utils).
- The frontend (index.html) communicates only with the backend via defined endpoints.

---

## Security & Best Practices

- No passwords stored, only one-time code
- Sessions are server-side and expire after 8 hours
- Roles are strictly enforced
- Rate limiting on all sensitive endpoints
- All configuration in `.env` (never in git)

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Not receiving email?** Check SMTP settings and that your email/domain is in `approved_domains.json`.
- **Role missing?** Check that your email/domain has the correct roles in `approved_domains.json`.
- **File not found?** The app expects `approved_domains.json` to be present in the container at `/app/approved_domains.json`.
